Add experimental support for _taint labels_, that is the ability to attach labels to
different kinds of taint. This allows to write more complex taint rules that
previously required ugly workarounds. Taint labels also allows us to write certain
classes of typestate analyses (e.g., check that a file description is not used after
being closed).
