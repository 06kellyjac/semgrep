Allowed tainted variables from top-level environments to spread into function bodies.

For instance, a given the following example in Javascript:
```js
x = source

function foo () {
  sink(source)
}
```

If we are looking for a `sink($SINK)`, before this Pr it would not be caught, because
function bodies are all analyzed separately, with empty contexts.
