METRICS: Using configs from the Registry (like --config=p/ci) reports pseudonymous rule metrics to semgrep.dev.
To disable Registry rule metrics, use "--metrics=off".
Using configs only from local files (like --config=xyz.yml) does not enable metrics.

Fetching rules from https://semgrep.dev/registry.

Rules downloaded from https://semgrep.dev/p/ci failed to parse.
This is likely because rules have been added that use functionality introduced in later versions of semgrep.
Please upgrade to latest version of semgrep (see https://semgrep.dev/docs/upgrading/) and try again.
